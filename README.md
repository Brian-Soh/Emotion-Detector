# Emotion Detector 
## Introduction

In this project, I designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify facial expressions into distinct emotion categories. I implemented the training pipeline in Python using Keras (MobileNet backbone) and deployed the trained model into a real-time C++/OpenCV pipeline for inference. The system performs face detection, preprocessing, and emotion classification on live video streams with low latency.
